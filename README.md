# Pygame CPU die temperature GUI

This is essentially a replacement for the command `sudo powermetrics --samplers smc |grep -i "CPU die temperature"` that lets MacOS users see the temperature of their CPU. Took about a day to make. Not very complicated.

Some parts of the code were written using ChatGPT.
